# node-server

Express.js is a powerful and popular tool we can use to create servers.

People use these libraries to make our lives easier

`npm install express`

# How do we initiate an express server? 

`const express = require('express');`

`const app = express();`

`app.listen(3000);`

express is really good at routing <br>

express had this concept of middleware. it gets the request of the website, we can do whatever we want with it.
Then we hit next and express keeps running through the routes <br>
